			<h2>Mods</h2>
			<i>Personally I'd call this more of a place for my projects but it's fine</i>
			<br>
			<h3>ResourceFix</h3>
			<p>Currently discontinued at the moment, I might work on it again soon.</p>
			<p>ResourceFix is a resource pack that reroutes 1.12.2 models to use their 1.13 equivalents.</p>
			<p>This allows most 1.13+ texture packs to run on 1.12.2.</p>
			<p>1.8 is currently broken due to it using different blockstate syntax.</p>
			<a target="blank" aria-label="Download ResourceFix" href="http://modrinth.com/resourcepack/resourcefix"><button>Download ResourceFix</button></a>
			<br>
			<h3>The 128MB Pack</h3>
			<p>A simple modpack for people who <b>really</b> want to push their game to the bare minimum.</b>
			<br><br>
			<p>Note: Crashes extremely frequently so be ready for that</p>
			<a target="blank" aria-label="Download The 128MB Pack" href="http://modrinth.com/modpack/the-128mb-pack"><button>Download The 128MB Pack</button></a>
			<h3>MCUnlocked</h3>
			<p>One of my largest projects, MCUnlocked currently spans through every single version to a1.0.15 - 1.7.10.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Note: b1.5_01, b1.4_01, and a1.2.0 - 1.2.3 are left out due to MCP not supporting them entirely, or properly.</p>
			<a target="blank" aria-label="Download MCUnlocked" href="http://mcunlocked.github.io"><button>Download MCUnlocked</button></a>
			<h3>BedCraft</h3>
			<p>Currently in progress, BedCraft is a mod that breaks 1.5.2 at high distances as thoroughly as possible.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Development report: As of 11/29 the mod is pretty much finished, but the Far Lands are being worked on.</p>
			<button>Coming soon</button>
			<h3>XRay+</h3>
			<p>XRay+ is a simple and lightweight XRay texure pack that focuses on being lightweight and minimalistic.</p>
			<p>I originally started it due to my MacBook being unable to run it stably, but now it serves as a fast XRay alternative for low end computers.</p>
			<a target="blank" aria-label="Download XRay+" href="http://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xray-plus"><button>Download XRay+</button></a>
