			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I learned web development in June of 2023.</p>
			<p>I immediately started to have fun with it so here we are.</p>
			<p>The reason for the extremely dated design is due to this website actually being made for IE6.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, this website was even made with Notepad on Windows 2000.</p>
			<p>Anyway, here's some information about me!</p>
			<br>
			<p>My favorite Minecraft versions are rd-160052, c0.0.14a_08, 1.2.5, b1.3_01 and 1.17.</p>
			<p>I started playing the game in 2020, but I have played Geometry Dash for over 5 years. (2.2 will be interesting!)</p>
			<p>As of recently, I have started to experiment with Java Edition jar modding.</p>
